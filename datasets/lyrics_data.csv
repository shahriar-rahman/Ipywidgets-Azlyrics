0,"""In The Rain"" lyrics","Leave me in the rain
And I might still learn my lesson
Leave me in the rain
I will take it as a blessing

I wanna see myself in your eyes
Though I know it's gonna hurt like hell
I wanna bathe in my own sweet lies
Ain't nothing the truth won't tell

Leave me in the rain
And I might still learn my lesson
Leave me in the rain
I will take it as a blessing

I wanna see myself in your eyes
Though I know it's gonna hurt like hell
I wanna bathe in my own sweet lies
Ain't nothing the truth won't tell

Leave me in the rain
And I might still learn my lesson
Leave me in the rain
I will take it as a blessing

I wanna see myself in your eyes
Though I know it's gonna hurt like hell
I wanna bathe in my own sweet lies
Ain't nothing the truth won't tell","

1,"""1984"" lyrics","Chasing dreams
Walked too far
Like in 1984
Take my hand
Let's get lost
Like in 1984
Cold beer and blue nights
The band plays till sunrise
Yeah, oh, oh

Chasing dreams
Walked too far
Like in 1984
Take my hand
Let's get lost
Like in 1984
Cold beer and blue nights
The band plays till sunrise

Like in 1984
Like in 1984
Like in, like in
Like in 1984

Like in 1984
Like in 1984

Chasing dreams
Walked too far
Like in 1984
Take my hand
Let's get lost
Like in 1984
Cold beer and blue nights
The band plays till sunrise

Like in 1984
Like in 1984
Like in, like in
Like in 1984
Like in 1984
Like in 1984","
