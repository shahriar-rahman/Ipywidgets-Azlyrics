0,"""High Voltage"" lyrics","Just do something to tell you who I am, ya know?

[4x]
It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

I've been digging into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
Mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
And chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumentalness
And all of the MCs that hate us
So try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones

I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
(Mixed Media)
The stamp of approval is on this

It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

Akira
Put a kink in the backbones of clones
With microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day
Over what you might say
Blood type Krylon
Technicolor type A

On highways ride with road rage
I'm patient to win
The cages of the tin
That bounce all around
In surround sound

Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene
Paintings
Overall the same thing

Sing song karaoke copy madness
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension
Combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention (attention)

Meant to put you away with the pencil
Pistol, official
16 line rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out all your flaws
Spin rah blah blah blah
You can say you saw

[Mike Shinoda:]
It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

High voltage

It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

It's high voltage
You can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop
Check it out

1,"""72 Seasons"" lyrics","Feeding on the wrath of man

Shot down
Traumatic
Time haunted by the past
Long gone
Dogmatic
Although the die is cast
Shot down
Volcanic
But what is done is done and done
Look back
Psychotic
No chance before this life began

Staring into black light
Dominating birthright

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Feeding on the wrath of man

Shoot back
Erratic
Mad seasons take their toll
New mask
Chaotic
Completely lost control
Shoot back
Fanatic
Wither under looming shadow cast
Slip back
Narcotic
Blinded by the ashes of the past

Staring into black light
Choking on the stage fright

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Piercing through
Cut in two
Polarize
Point of view
Crash into
Paralyze

Feeding on the wrath of man

Man down
Barbaric
Quick fire machine gun thoughts
Deep seed
Stigmatic
Some have and some have not
Man down
Demonic
No mercy from the ghost within
Turn back
Hypnotic
There's breathing out but not back in

Staring into black light
Permanently midnight

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Feeding on the wrath of man","
