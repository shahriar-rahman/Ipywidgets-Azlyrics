0,"""Yellow Submarine"" lyrics","In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
'Til we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sergeant!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye!
Captain, Captain!

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Everyone of us (everyone of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ah-ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine","

1,"""Keys To The Kingdom"" lyrics","[Chester Bennington:]
No control! No surprise!
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty!
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility!

[Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington:]
We start the final war
Tell me what's worth fighting for
When we know there's nothing more
Take the hand or fist
Just to sell ourselves for this
The path we least resist

[Chester Bennington:]
No control! No surprise!
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty!
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility!

[Mike Shinoda:]
Uh, I give you what you came for
This is not the same though
Got a different method
But I still can bring the pain so
Y'all get that same flow
I got that insane flow
High as y'all can get
You're never really in my range, though
Yes, I'm half Anglo
Half fried Panko
All prime-time
I'mma let the bass bang low
All you fucking lames go
Aiming at my name, know
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
(Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for)

[Chester Bennington:]
No control! No surprise!
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty!
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Instrumental break]

[Chester Bennington:]
No control! No surprise!
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty! [2x]

[Kid:]
I'm not allowed to say certain things, ah!

[Mike Shinoda:]
Try and do...
Try and do the other thing... real quick.","
