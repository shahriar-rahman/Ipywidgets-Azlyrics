0,"""Bigger Stronger"" lyrics","I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I think I want to change my altitude
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air
My atmosphere
I wanna recharge

I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

I think I need to change my attitude
I think I want to change my oxygen
I think I want to change my air
My atmosphere
I wanna recharge

Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go","

You feel it rushing through your blood, yeah

You feel it rushing through your blood

2,"""1984"" lyrics","Chasing dreams
Walked too far
Like in 1984
Take my hand
Let's get lost
Like in 1984
Cold beer and blue nights
The band plays till sunrise
Yeah, oh, oh

Chasing dreams
Walked too far
Like in 1984
Take my hand
Let's get lost
Like in 1984
Cold beer and blue nights
The band plays till sunrise

Like in 1984
Like in 1984
Like in, like in
Like in 1984

Like in 1984
Like in 1984

Chasing dreams
Walked too far
Like in 1984
Take my hand
Let's get lost
Like in 1984
Cold beer and blue nights
The band plays till sunrise

Like in 1984
Like in 1984
Like in, like in
Like in 1984
Like in 1984
Like in 1984","
