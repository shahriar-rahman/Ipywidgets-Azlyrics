0,"""Born Again"" lyrics","As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At the tapestries all faded
Their vague and distant glories
Concealed in the gloom
The icy fingers of forgotten passions
Softly brushing my lips
At the tips of my primitive soul

As you look through my door
Deep into my room
Can you feel the mighty wall of power
It's waiting waiting in the glow
The distant shadows of forgotten champions
Those who live in me still
And will rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

Look at this prince of evil
Fighting for your mind
Fighting all priests of shame
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed
At the hearts of mutant gods
Who think we're all the same
They're controlling our minds
And they use us for fortune and fame

As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At your future and freedom
The grey and plastic retards all floating in circles
And as you taste the fruits of new sensations
Softly brushing your lips
As we rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

If you want to be a king for a day
Just do what I say

Everybody's got to think like a hunter
Just search for your pray

Be alive through the night and the day
Just do it my way","

1,"""Slow Down"" lyrics","Well, come on pretty baby, won't you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, won't you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now you're movin' way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin'
Ow! If you want our love to last

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school
Carry your books home, too
But now you got a boyfriend down the street
Baby what you're tryin' to do?

You better slow down!
Baby, now you're movin' way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin'
Bbbbb! If you want our love to last

Well you know that I love you, tell the world I do
Come on, pretty baby, why can't you be true?
I need your lovin' baby, oh so bad
The best little woman I ever had

Slow down, baby, now you're movin' way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin'
Ow! If you want our love to last","

2,"""Flick Of The Switch"" lyrics","Well there's a love goin' down on mine
Suicidal voltage line
She sends signals out of distress
She devil, she evil
She got you reelin' on a rockin' machine

With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she can satisfy

She gonna blow you all sky high
Flash the eye, electrify
A power force you should feel
She devil, she evil
She get you screamin' on a lightnin' machine

With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she can satisfy
Give you pain, blow your brain

Flick the switch, flick the switch
With a flick of the switch, she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch, she can satisfy
With a flick of the switch, yeah, gonna burn you down
With a flick of the switch, razed to the ground
With a flick of the switch 
With a flick of the switch 
With a flick of the switch, she gonna give you pain
With a flick of the switch, she gonna blow your brain
Blow your brain

She gonna put the light out on you","
