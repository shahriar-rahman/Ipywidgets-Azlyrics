0,"""I Will Follow"" lyrics","I will follow

I was on the outside
When you said, you said you needed me
And I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see

A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow

I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found

Walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow

Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes
Your, your, your eyes
Your eyes, just give me
Your, your, your eyes
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
Follow","

1,"""The Electric Co."" lyrics","Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to

Toy, broken toy
Shout, shout, you're inside out

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

Red, running red
Play for real
Talk and feel
A hole in your head
You won't shout
You're spoon fed

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

Two, three, four
I can't stop
Useless is the castle wall
Useless is the metal wall
He's gonna jump

If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co
If you don't know
Electric Co

Till someone leaves him below
He's searched high and low
A tap on the wrist and he'd know
Somebody hear him
Just leave him
I can't find my way home
I'm alone
I've lost my way home
You know and you know
And you know and you know
And you know","

2,"""Twilight"" lyrics","I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry

My body grows and grows
It frightens me you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known

Twilight...
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way

In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man

I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play
It's all; it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin

Twilight...darkened day
Twilight...lost my way
Twilight...night and day
Twilight...can't find my way

Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way

Twilight...darkened day
Twilight...lost my way
Twilight...night and day
Twilight...can't find my way

In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man","
